# kms

Secrets and signing for the Hanzo platform. Per-org namespaces, AI-aware approval policies, dynamic secrets, SSH/PKI/certificate management.

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)]()

## Quick start

```bash
docker run -p 80:80 ghcr.io/hanzoai/kms:latest
```

Open `http://localhost:80`.

## What this is

`kms` is the canonical secret store and signing service for every Hanzo deployment. Holds per-tenant DEKs that back `base`, provider API keys consumed by `ai` and `gateway`, certificate material, and signing keys. AI agents are first-class identities: every secret has a policy controlling whether Claude / GPT / any agent can read it (auto-approve, requires-approval, blocked) with full per-agent audit trail.

## Specs

Implements:
- HIP-0027 KMS
- HIP-0106 Unified Cloud Binary (kms subsystem)
- HIP-0302 Encrypted SQLite + ZapDB Durability (DEK source)

## Architecture

```
   service / agent  ->  kms (zip.App)  ->  per-org namespace
                              |
                  IAM identity (HIP-0026 JWT)
                              |
              policy gate: auto-approve | requires-approval | blocked
                              |
   master DEK -> HKDF per-org -> per-record DEK   (base / replicate)
                              |
                  audit log: who, what secret, when, why
```

## Introduction

**Hanzo KMS** is the open-source key management service built for the AI era — centralize secrets, API keys, and certificates across your infrastructure with first-class AI access controls.

Built by [Hanzo AI](https://hanzo.ai), we believe you should always control what AI can access. Every secret has a policy: some auto-approve for development velocity, others require explicit human sign-off before any AI agent can read them.

## AI Access Control

**Your secrets, your rules.** AI agents are first-class citizens in Hanzo KMS — and so is your ability to block them.

- **Per-secret AI policies**: Mark any secret as _human-approval required_ for AI access. Claude, GPT, or any agent requesting that secret triggers a real-time approval request.
- **Auto-approve mode**: Building fast? Set policies to auto-approve for your team's agents — flip to manual approval before shipping.
- **Device & agent tracking**: See exactly which AI model, tool, or agent accessed which secret and when.
- **Full audit trail**: Every secret read by an AI is logged with the agent identity, timestamp, and reason.
- **One-tap approval**: Approve or deny AI secret requests from Slack, email, or the KMS dashboard.

```
Secret: STRIPE_LIVE_KEY
  AI Access Policy: requires-human-approval
  Last accessed by: claude-sonnet-4-6 via hanzo-mcp
  Status: waiting for your approval → [Approve] [Deny]
```

## Features

### Secrets Management

- **Dashboard**: Manage secrets across projects and environments through a user-friendly interface.
- **Secret Syncs**: Sync secrets to platforms like GitHub, Vercel, AWS, and use tools like Terraform, Ansible, and more.
- **Secret versioning** and **Point-in-Time Recovery**: Track every secret and project state; roll back when needed.
- **Secret Rotation**: Rotate secrets at regular intervals for services like PostgreSQL, MySQL, AWS IAM, and more.
- **Dynamic Secrets**: Generate ephemeral secrets on-demand for services like PostgreSQL, MySQL, RabbitMQ, and more.
- **Secret Scanning and Leak Prevention**: Prevent secrets from leaking to git.
- **Kubernetes Operator**: Deliver secrets to your Kubernetes workloads and automatically reload deployments.
- **KMS Agent**: Inject secrets into applications without modifying any code logic.

### Certificate Management

- **Internal CA**: Create and manage a private CA hierarchy directly within KMS.
- **External CA**: Integrate with third-party certificate authorities such as Let's Encrypt, DigiCert, Microsoft AD CS, and more.
- **Certificate Lifecycle Management**: Create certificate profiles and policies to control how certificates are issued.
- **Certificate Syncs**: Sync certificates to external platforms like AWS Certificate Manager and Azure Key Vault.
- **Alerting**: Configure alerting for expiring CA and end-entity certificates.

### Key Management System (KMS)

- **Cryptographic Keys**: Centrally manage keys across projects through a user-friendly interface or via the API.
- **Encrypt and Decrypt Data**: Use symmetric keys to encrypt and decrypt data.

### SSH Management

- **Signed SSH Certificates**: Issue ephemeral SSH credentials for secure, short-lived, and centralized access to infrastructure.

### AI Access Control (New)

- **AI Identity Tracking**: Identify which AI model or agent is requesting secrets — Claude, GPT, Gemini, or any MCP-compatible tool.
- **Per-secret AI policies**: Set `auto-approve`, `requires-approval`, or `blocked` per secret per AI identity.
- **Real-time approval requests**: Pending AI secret reads appear in your dashboard, Slack, or email — one tap to approve or deny.
- **Auto-approve mode**: Teams move fast by default; escalate specific secrets to manual approval as you go to production.
- **Device registry**: Register and manage AI agent devices; revoke access instantly.
- **AI audit log**: Separate audit trail for all AI-originated secret reads, with model ID, tool name, and request context.

### General Platform

- **Authentication Methods**: Authenticate machine identities with KMS using cloud-native or platform agnostic authentication methods (Kubernetes Auth, GCP Auth, Azure Auth, AWS Auth, OIDC Auth, Universal Auth).
- **Access Controls**: Define advanced authorization controls for users and machine identities with RBAC, additional privileges, temporary access, access requests, approval workflows, and more.
- **Audit logs**: Track every action taken on the platform.
- **Self-hosting**: Deploy KMS on-prem or cloud with ease; keep data on your own infrastructure.
- **SDKs**: Interact with KMS via client SDKs (Node, Python, Go, Ruby, Java, .NET)
- **CLI**: Interact with KMS via CLI; useful for injecting secrets into local development and CI/CD pipelines.
- **API**: Interact with KMS via REST API.

## Getting Started

### Run KMS locally

To set up and run KMS locally, make sure you have Git and Docker installed on your system. Then run:

**Linux/macOS:**
```console
git clone https://github.com/hanzoai/kms && cd kms && cp .env.dev.example .env && docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up
```

**Windows Command Prompt:**
```console
git clone https://github.com/hanzoai/kms && cd kms && copy .env.dev.example .env && docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up
```

Create an account at `http://localhost:80`

### Scan and prevent secret leaks

Scan for over 140+ secret types in your files, directories, and git repositories.

To scan your full git history, run:
```
hanzo-kms scan --verbose
```

Install pre-commit hook to scan each commit before you push:
```
hanzo-kms scan install --pre-commit-hook
```
